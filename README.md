This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Template customization

This project is organized as a reusable template. Update the following files first:

- `lib/config/site.ts` for brand name, support contacts, locale, and currency.
- `lib/config/marketing.ts` for hero copy, preview cards, highlights, and CTAs.
- `lib/billing/plans.ts` for pricing tiers and storage limits.
- `app/terms/page.tsx`, `app/privacy/page.tsx`, and `app/refund-policy/page.tsx` for legal copy.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
